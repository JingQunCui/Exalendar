### DO ###
- All measurements in vw, unless using % of parent div size (where the parent div is sized in vw)
- Use all colors from pre-existing pallet.

### DO NOT ###
- Alterate measurements between vw, px, rem , etc. Please keep everything consistent.
- Do not eyeball colors
- Do not use extremely high contrast colors. Keep accessibility in mind.
- Try not to use excessively

- Use vh, please base measurements off of vw. Do not alternate between vw and vh ever. This is worse than vw/px alternation / vw/rem alternation.
