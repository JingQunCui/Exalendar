To the viewer/team member: The photos in this folder are Drawings for what the main calendar pages were meant to look like. These ideas have changed over time and whomever is working on the calendar is not required to follow this. You can change what you like. But please know the original page was designed with these ideas in mind, feel free to base new features on the drawings, or alter them, or do your own thing. I've changed my ideas and that can be seen in this image. Nothing is set.
This is just the original vision set for what the Calendar page's layout. 
Feel free to leave feedback or propose ideas.
