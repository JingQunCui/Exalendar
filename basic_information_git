Basic information
You can use Github desktop for commits/branch changes/see the difference etc

If you want to stick to the commandline for windows:
To switch branch
git switch "name of branch"
note: new branches in the repo need to be pulled before switching to them 


To create a new branch:
git branch "name of the branch"
note: the branch is made from the branch you were most recently in, you might need to switch to master or such before creating your branch

To check status
git status

To check which branch
git branch

If you haven't committed yet you will have to either stash things 'git stash' or commit and then checkout 'git checkout'

To add file:
git add * // this is for all new files
git add "name of file" //individual files

To commit to branch
git commit -m "name of the commit"
or
git commit

How to commit (my recommendation)
status
add
commit // these are just the commands, the syntax is above

git pull // get changes from repo into ur local
git push // push commits from ur local into the repo where everyone can see them

I will add the merge commands at a later date that can be messy so I don't want to put that up yet
